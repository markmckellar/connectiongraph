# walkers

1) Install Node.js and gulp
$ npm -g install gulp

2) Install dependencies and their type definitions:
$ npm install
```

This code base is in the pre stages of development.  It can be built but with errors by running :
* gulp build_matter
The resulting bundled JS file can be tested by loading :
* walkers/source/test_matter.html
...into a browser.
